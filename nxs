# nxs is a simple software installer designed to manage
# AppImage packages. When install is requested, it looks
# for the requested package in local database, and, if
# found, then it installs it (downloads) in 
# $HOME/.local/apps.
#
# When deletion is requested, it looks if the app exists
# in the apps directory and if so, it just deletes it.
#
# It can update all the packages installed to the latest
# version available also. List the ones installed or
# available for installation is supported too.
#
# Very easy, very funny. =D
